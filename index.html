        <li> An example of a selector is the img selector, where we can then write rules we want for a linked image.</li>
        <li>An example of a property is the height property, which has both the img selector assigned to it linking it to the image, and the 50 px value applied to it making the image 50 pixels in height.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element, while a padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
