        <li>HTML or HyperText Markup Language is madeup of elements that provide basic content and structure to a webpage.</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Child elements are elements nested inside other elements. A good example is the bullet points you're currently reading, which are each child elements to a ul "Unordered List" element, which is itself a child element to the body element, or the "Parent Element."</li>

      <ul>
        <li>A selector is assigned to the following property and the value applied to it.</li>
        <li> An example of a selector is the img selector, where we can then write rules we want for a linked image.</li>
        <li>An example of a property is the height property, which has both the img selector assigned to it linking it to the image, and the 50 px value applied to it making the image 50 pixels in height.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
